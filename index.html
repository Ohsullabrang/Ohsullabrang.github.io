                ----------------------------------------
                Barack Obama's tenure as the 44th 
                president of the United States began 
                with his first inauguration on January 
                20, 2009, and ended on January 20, 2017. 
                A Democrat from Illinois, Obama took 
                office following a decisive victory over 
                Republican nominee John McCain in the 
                2008 presidential election. Four years 
                later, in the 2012 presidential election, 
                he defeated Republican nominee Mitt Romney 
                to win re-election. Obama is the first 
                African American president, the first 
                multiracial president, the first non-white 
                president,[a] and the first president born 
                in Hawaii.
